collection: publications
permalink: /publication/AMR-GEC
excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose the AMR-GEC, a seq-to-seq model that incorporates denoised AMR as additional knowledge. Specifically, We design a semantic aggregated GEC model and explore denoising methods to get AMRs more reliable. Experiments on the BEA-2019 shared task and the CoNLL-2014 shared task have shown that AMR-GEC performs comparably to a set of strong baselines with a large number of synthetic data.'
